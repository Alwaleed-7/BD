                        <h2>Introduction and Evolution of Big Data</h2>
                        <p>Big Data refers to a collection of data characterized by its massive volume, which grows exponentially over time. Its size and complexity exceed the capabilities of traditional data management tools. The exponential growth is driven by several factors:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Evolution of Technology:</strong> The shift from devices like telephones and desktop PCs to mobile devices, cloud computing, and smart cars (IoT) generates immense streams of data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT):</strong> A network of physical devices embedded with sensors that collect and exchange data over the internet, driving growth in sectors like healthcare, logistics, and automotive. IoT is expected to grow to over 29 billion connected devices by 2027.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter generate millions of messages, posts, and media uploads every minute.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other Factors:</strong> This includes Machine Data (server logs), Social Data (online interactions), Transaction Data (purchase receipts), Sensor Data (GPS, weather), Public Data (census), and Commercial Data (market research).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The challenge lies in capturing this massive, raw data and transforming it into valuable business insights at the right speed and time.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Failure of Traditional Databases (RDBMS)</h2>
                        <p>Traditional Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) failed to handle the Big Data era due to fundamental architectural limitations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Volume Constraint:</strong> RDBMS scales vertically (increasing processor/memory on a single machine), which is costly and constrained. Big Data scales horizontally (adding more cheap, commodity hardware nodes).</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Type:</strong> RDBMS is optimized for structured data, but â‰ˆ80% of modern data is semi-structured or unstructured.</li>
                            <li><strong>Velocity Constraint:</strong> RDBMS struggles to capture and process data arriving at the high velocity required for real-time analysis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Schema:</strong> RDBMS requires a static schema, while Big Data systems use a dynamic schema to handle data variety.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>The Characteristics of Big Data (The 5 Vs)</h2>
                        
                        <h3>Volume (Size)</h3>
                        <p>Refers to the massive size of data, ranging from terabytes (TB) to petabytes (PB), zettabytes (ZB), and beyond. The total amount of data created globally is projected to exceed 180 ZB by 2025.</p>
                        <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> The immense size presents challenges for Storage (necessitating distributed file systems like HDFS), Access, and Processing (requiring distributed computing like MapReduce/Spark).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Variety (Complexity)</h3>
                        <p>Refers to the heterogeneity of data formats:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> Highly organized data that fits into fixed schemas (e.g., Relational Database tables).</li>
                            <li><strong>Semi-Structured Data:</strong> Does not conform to a rigid structure but contains tags or markers to separate data elements (e.g., XML, JSON, log files).</li>
                            <li><strong>Unstructured Data:</strong> Lacks a predefined format, making it challenging to analyze with traditional methods (e.g., emails, videos, images, free-form text). This makes up the majority of generated data.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Velocity (Speed)</h3>
                        <p>Refers to the increasing speed at which data is generated and the speed at which it needs to be processed.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Real-Time Processing:</strong> Instantly captures streaming data and processes it immediately to enable quick actions (e.g., fraud detection, live healthcare monitoring).</li>
                            <li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> Data is collected, cleaned, and processed later in chunks, which is slower and can lead to missed opportunities for time-sensitive decisions.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Veracity (Quality)</h3>
                        <p>Refers to the quality, accuracy, reliability, and trustworthiness of the data. Big Data is often noisy, inconsistent, and uncertain.</p>
                        <p><strong>Uncertainty Sources:</strong> Unstructured nature of social media, high velocity leaving little time for traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) quality checks, and sheer volume.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The Google Flu Trends overestimation in 2013 demonstrated the danger of relying solely on uncertain big data without proper context and quality assurance. Data Provenance (tracking data history and transformation) is crucial.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Value (Insight)</h3>
                        <p>The ultimate goal of processing Big Data is to extract meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making. Without analysis, the data has little to no commercial value.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Big Data Technology</h2>
                        <p>Big Data technology is the suite of tools and frameworks designed for the processing, storage, and analysis of massive datasets.</p>
                        <h4>Data Storage Solutions</h4>
                        <ul>

                            <li><strong>NoSQL Databases:</strong> Non-relational databases for flexible handling of diverse data types and structures (e.g., HBase, Cassandra, MongoDB).</li>
                            <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Scalable services like Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Data Processing and Analysis Tools</h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li><strong>Apache Hadoop:</strong> An open-source framework for distributed storage (HDFS) and batch processing (MapReduce).</li>
                           <li><strong>Apache Spark:</strong> A faster, in-memory distributed computing system used for batch and real-time processing (Spark Streaming) and machine learning (MLlib).</li>
                           <li><strong>Apache Hive:</strong> A data warehousing system providing a SQL-like query language (HiveQL) on top of Hadoop for ad-hoc queries.</li>
                           <li><strong>H2O / Azure ML:</strong> Platforms and tools for scalable machine learning, predictive modeling, and NLP.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>The Big Data Life Cycle</h2>
                        <p>The life cycle is a systematic process from data capture to decision support.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Data Aggregation (Capture and Acquisition):</strong> Involves acquiring high-volume, raw data from various sources (online banking, social media, sensors).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Data Preprocessing (Transformation):</strong> Transforms raw data into a clean, understandable format to ensure quality. Errors (negative values), Incompleteness (missing values), Inconsistency (mismatched date/age), and Redundancy (duplicates) are addressed. Key steps include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Integration (combining sources)</li>
                                    <li>Cleaning (fixing errors)</li>
                                    <li>Reduction (compression/dimensionality)</li>
                                    <li>Transformation (changing format). Transformation Strategies include: Smoothing (removing noise via binning/regression), Aggregation (summarizing, e.g., daily monthly profit), Generalization (moving up hierarchies, e.g., street â†’ city), and Discretization (converting continuous age to categories like 'adult').</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Analytics and Visualization:</strong> Big Data Analytics combines technology and analytical tools (statistics, AI) to find patterns.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Types of Analytics: Descriptive (What happened?), Predictive (What will happen?), and Prescriptive (What should we do?).</li>
                                    <li>Visualization (using tools like Tableau) makes the insights accessible for decision-making.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Big Data Storage Architecture</h2>
                        <p>Traditional storage systems, particularly Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), are inadequate for handling the Volume, Velocity, and Variety of Big Data. New architectures, such as Hadoop, were developed to overcome these challenges by using clusters of commodity hardware (inexpensive, standard servers). This approach ensures storage is cost-effective, scalable, and flexible enough to handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.</p>
                        <p>The typical architecture involves:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raw data (Machine, Web, Audio/Video, External) is ingested into a Hadoop Cluster (acting as a Data Lake).</li>
                            <li>The data is processed and refined.</li>
                            <li>Cleaned data is moved into a Data Warehouse (optimized for querying and reporting).</li>
                            <li>Users run ad-hoc queries against the Data Warehouse for insights.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Cluster Computing</h2>
                        <p>A cluster is a distributed system where multiple stand-alone computers, connected via a Local Area Network (LAN), work together as a single, highly available virtual machine under one administrative domain.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cluster Benefits</h3>
                        <p>The use of clusters provides critical benefits for Big Data systems:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Nodes can be added or removed without disrupting operations.</li>
                            <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> If one node fails, others continue the work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Automatic failover mechanisms transfer work from a failed node to a healthy one (no human intervention needed).</li>
                            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Utilizes commodity hardware instead of expensive supercomputers.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Types and Structure of Clusters</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>High Availability Clusters:</strong> Designed to minimize downtime. Nodes require access to shared storage, enabling a failed node's service to automatically failover to an active node.</li>
                            <li><strong>Load Balancing Clusters:</strong> Designed to share the computational workload among nodes to optimize performance, maximize throughput, and prevent any single node from being overloaded.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Load Balancing Techniques</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Round Robin:</strong> Distributes requests sequentially.</li>
                            <li><strong>Weight-Based:</strong> Assigns more requests to servers with higher capacity (higher weight).</li>
                            <li><strong>Server Affinity:</strong> Routes a specific client's subsequent requests back to the same server they initially connected to.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Cluster Structure (Symmetry)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Symmetric Clusters (Active-Active):</strong> All nodes are active, run applications, and share the workload. No node is purely passive.</li>
                            <li><strong>Asymmetric Clusters (Active-Passive):</strong> Some nodes are active, while others are designated as "hot standby" (passive) and only take over if an active node fails.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Data Distribution Models</h2>
                        <p>To handle massive datasets across clusters, data must be distributed efficiently.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Replication</h3>
                        <p>Replication is placing the same set of data (a replica or copy) across multiple nodes.
                        <strong>Advantages:</strong> Provides fault tolerance (data is not lost when a node crashes) and increases data availability.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Master-Slave Model:</strong> Writes occur only on the Master node and are replicated to Slave nodes. Reads are handled by the Slaves. This is efficient for intensive read requests.</li>
                            <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Model:</strong> All nodes are equal, sharing the same responsibility. Communication is decentralized, and the model supports scalability for both reads and writes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Sharding</h3>
                        <p>Sharding is partitioning a very large dataset into smaller, easily manageable chunks called shards, and placing these different sets of data on different nodes.
                        <strong>Advantages:</strong> Increases horizontal scalability (by adding new nodes/shards), improves performance (queries run on smaller subsets), and enhances fault tolerance (failure of one node only affects its shard, not the entire dataset).</p>

                        <h3>Sharding and Replication</h3>
                        <p>These models are often combined to achieve maximum system reliability. The dataset is first split into shards, and then each shard is replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring the data is both distributed and redundant.</p>

                        <h2>Distributed File System (DFS)</h2>
                        <p>A Distributed File System stores files across multiple cluster nodes while appearing as a single, local file system to the client. This allows simultaneous file access by multiple clients and manages data replication to prevent version conflicts. The most prominent example in Big Data is the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).</p>

                        <h2>Scaling Up and Scaling Out Storage</h2>
                        <p>Scalability is the system's ability to meet increasing demand. Storage platforms scale in two primary ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Scaling Up (Vertical Scalability):</strong> Adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to the existing single server. This has physical and cost limitations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scaling Out (Horizontal Scalability):</strong> Adding new, low-cost servers or components to the cluster. This is the preferred method for Big Data systems due to its high scalability and cost-effectiveness.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Relational and Non-Relational Databases</h2>
                        
                        <h3>RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Primarily vertical (Scale Up).</li>
                            <li><strong>Schema:</strong> Fixed, static schema enforced during writes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Properties:</strong> Adheres to ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure reliable, high-integrity transactions.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>NoSQL Databases (Not Only SQL)</h3>
                        <p>NoSQL databases emerged to address Big Data challenges related to variety and volume.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Design:</strong> Schemaless (dynamic schema); supports multiple data formats (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).</li>
                            <li><strong>Model:</strong> Operates on the BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent).</li>
                            <li><strong>CAP Theorem Trade-offs:</strong> Describes that a distributed database can only exhibit two of three properties (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) simultaneously. NoSQL systems typically choose AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance) over strict Consistency.</li>
                            <li><strong>Types:</strong> Key-value (Redis), Document (MongoDB), Column (Cassandra), and Graph (Neo4j).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>NewSQL Databases</h3>
                        <p>NewSQL databases attempt to combine the horizontal scalability and fault tolerance of NoSQL with the transactional integrity (ACID properties) and relational data model of traditional RDBMS. They are designed for high transaction volume workloads that require high consistency.</p>

                        <h2>Why Hadoop? Overcoming the Disk Latency Bottleneck</h2>
                        <p>Despite rapid improvements in CPU speed, RAM memory, and disk capacity over the years, the Disk Latency (the speed of reads and writes) has not improved significantly. This creates a bottleneck when dealing with terabyte and petabyte-scale data on a single machine.</p>
                        <p>Hadoop solves this problem through parallelism and scaling-out (horizontal scaling). By distributing a large dataset across hundreds of disks on different machines, data can be retrieved in parallel, eliminating the bottleneck. For example, reading 1TB of data across 1000 disks takes only about 12 seconds, compared to 3.4 hours on a single disk. Hadoop's core philosophy is to move the computation to the data, not the data to the computation.</p>
                        
                        <h2>History of Hadoop</h2>
                        <p>Hadoop was created by Doug Cutting, the creator of Apache Lucene, and named after his son's toy elephant. Its foundation is rooted in two seminal Google white papers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Google File System (GFS) (2003):</strong> Presented a scalable, fault-tolerant distributed file system running on commodity hardware. Data is split into large chunks and replicated.</li>
                            <li><strong>Google MapReduce Framework (2004):</strong> Introduced a simple programming model for parallel processing of massive data using two developer-defined functions: Map (to turn input into key-value pairs) and Reduce (to aggregate values by key).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Doug Cutting implemented these concepts as the core of Hadoop: the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) (based on GFS) and Hadoop MapReduce (based on Google's framework). Hadoop became an Apache Top Level Project in 2008.</p>

                        <h2>What is Hadoop?</h2>
                        <p>Apache Hadoop is an open-source framework written in Java for distributed computing and large-scale data processing.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Stores and manages structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data across a distributed file system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Runs on clusters of commodity hardware (low-cost, standard servers), making it highly cost-effective and scalable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Access Pattern:</strong> Provides a streaming access pattern (large sequential reads/writes, no random access) and operates on a write-once, read-many model (files cannot be modified once closed, though appending data is possible).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h2>Hadoop Core Components</h2>
                        <p>Hadoop consists of three key components:</p>

                        <h3>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Provides distributed storage for large datasets across the cluster.</p>
                        <p><strong>Architecture:</strong> Follows a Master/Slave model.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>NameNode (Master Node):</strong> Manages the file system metadata (directory structure, file-to-block mapping, block locations). It does not store the actual data. It tracks the health of DataNodes via Heartbeat signals.</li>
                            <li><strong>DataNodes (Slave Nodes):</strong> Store the actual data blocks and periodically report their status to the NameNode.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Block Size:</strong> Files are split into large blocks (default 128MB or 256MB) which are replicated (default: 3 copies) across different DataNodes for fault tolerance.</p>
                        <p><strong>NameNode Limitations:</strong> It is a Single Point of Failure (SPOF) in older Hadoop versions. Since metadata is stored in memory, it is not suitable for storing a large number of small files.</p>
                        <p><strong>High Availability (HA):</strong> Hadoop 2 introduced an Active NameNode and a Standby NameNode architecture. The Standby is kept synchronized via Journal Nodes (which store edit logs) and can automatically take over if the Active node fails, eliminating SPOF.</p>

                        <h3>MapReduce</h3>
                        <p><strong>Function:</strong> The batch-processing programming model for computation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Principle - Data Locality:</strong> Computation is moved to the data, meaning code is executed on the nodes where the data resides. This minimizes network congestion and significantly improves throughput.</p>

                        <h3>YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)</h3>
                        <p><strong>Function:</strong> Introduced in Hadoop 2.0 as the cluster resource management and job scheduling framework.</p>
                        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Separated resource management from data processing, allowing MapReduce to focus only on computation. YARN enables Hadoop to run non-MapReduce frameworks (like Spark and Hive) on the same cluster.</p>
                        
                        <h2>HDFS Operations and Rack Awareness</h2>

                        <h3>HDFS Write Operation</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Client sends a write request to the NameNode.</li>
                            <li>NameNode checks the replication factor (default 3) and provides a list of DataNodes for block placement.</li>
                            <li>The input file is split into blocks, and the client sends the first data packet to the closest DataNode.</li>
                            <li>The DataNodes write the replicas in a pipelined fashion (1st -> 2nd -> 3rd DataNode).</li>
                            <li>Acknowledgments flow back from the last DataNode to the client once the block is successfully written on all replicas.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Rack Awareness</h3>
                        <p>This strategy determines how replicas are placed across physical racks in a data center to protect against failure at the node or rack level.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Default HDFS Policy (Fault Tolerance & Performance):</strong> For 3 replicas, the first replica is local to the client, the second is on a node in a different rack, and the third is on a different node within the second rack. This balances redundancy (two racks) with write performance (low latency for two nodes on the same rack).</li>
                            <li><strong>Rack-Fault-Tolerant Policy (Robust Fault Tolerance):</strong> Places all three replicas on three different racks. This provides the maximum protection against rack failures but increases network overhead.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>The Hadoop Ecosystem</h2>
                        <p>The Hadoop Ecosystem is a layered collection of tools that rely on HDFS and YARN.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Layer 1 (Storage):</strong> HDFS.</li>
                            <li><strong>Layer 2 (Resource Management):</strong> YARN.</li>
                            <li><strong>Layer 3 (Processing Engines):</strong> MapReduce, Spark (in-memory processing, fast), Storm/Flink (real-time processing).</li>
                            <li><strong>Layer 4 (Data Access/Application):</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Hive:</strong> Data warehousing layer that provides a SQL-like query language (HiveQL) for querying data stored in HDFS (developed at Facebook).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Pig:</strong> Provides a high-level data flow language for complex data transformations (developed at Yahoo).</li>
                                    <li><strong>NoSQL/Databases:</strong> HBase (NoSQL storage for low-latency access), Cassandra (distributed NoSQL), and MongoDB (document database) integrate with HDFS for non-file-based storage needs.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> Zookeeper provides centralized management, coordination, and synchronization for the distributed components (developed at Yahoo).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Hadoop Distributions (e.g., Cloudera Data Platform - CDP) package these tools together into enterprise-ready platforms, simplifying installation and ensuring compatibility.</p>

                        <h2>MapReduce: The Divide-and-Conquer Model</h2>
                        <p>MapReduce is the original batch-processing programming model for Hadoop, designed to process massive datasets by adopting a divide-and-conquer principle. The complexity of parallelization, scheduling, fault tolerance, and inter-machine communication is handled entirely by the framework, leaving the programmer to define only the core logic.</p>
                        
                        <h3>MapReduce Workflow</h3>
                        <p>The workflow is distributed across five main phases:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Read Input:</strong> The input data (stored in HDFS) is read as a set of key-value pairs (Input: <code>&lt;k,v&gt;</code>).</li>
                            <li><strong>Map:</strong> The user-defined Map function takes an input pair and transforms it into a new set of intermediate key-value pairs (Output: <code>&lt;k',v'&gt;*</code>). All map tasks are scheduled close to the physical storage location of the input data (Data Locality).</li>
                            <li><strong>Sorts & Shuffles:</strong> Intermediate <code>&lt;k',v'&gt;</code> pairs from all Map tasks are grouped by key. The system ensures all values belonging to the same key are sent to the same Reducer. This intermediate data is stored on the local file system of the Map worker nodes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduce:</strong> The user-defined Reduce function processes all <code>&lt;k',v'&gt;</code> pairs grouped by key and aggregates, summarizes, or filters the data to produce the final output (Output: <code>&lt;k'',v''&gt;</code>).</li>
                            <li><strong>Write Output:</strong> The final results are written back to HDFS, typically with each Reducer task producing one output file.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The system favors having many small Map tasks (where M >> number of nodes) to improve load balancing and ensure faster recovery from failures.</p>

                        <h3>Workflow Refinements</h3>
                        <h4>Combiner (Optional)</h4>
                        <p>An optional mini-reduce function that runs locally on the Map worker node, after the Map phase but before the Shuffle. Its purpose is solely performance optimization: it performs local aggregation to drastically reduce the amount of intermediate data transferred over the network. It can only be used if the Reduce function is commutative and associative (e.g., sum, count), but not for operations like median or average.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Partitioner (Optional)</h4>
                        <p>Decides which Reducer a key-value pair should go to. The default behavior uses <code>hash(key) (mod R)</code> (where R is the number of reducers) to ensure all values for the same key reach the same Reducer. Custom Partitioners are often created to override this default to prevent data skew and distribute the workload uniformly.</p>

                        <h3>Fault Tolerance (Coordination: Master)</h3>
                        <p>The Master node (JobTracker in MRv1) handles coordination, scheduling, and fault detection via heartbeats.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Map Worker Failure:</strong> If a Map worker fails, its completed and in-progress tasks are lost and must be reset to idle. This is because intermediate map output is stored locally on the worker node, not in HDFS.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduce Worker Failure:</strong> Only in-progress Reduce tasks are restarted, because completed Reduce tasks have their final output already stored reliably in HDFS.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>MapReduce v1 (MRv1): Architecture and Limitations</h2>
                        <p>The original Hadoop 1.2 architecture relied on two master/worker components:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>JobTracker (Master):</strong> The single centralized coordinator for all jobs.</li>
                            <li><strong>TaskTracker (Workers):</strong> Ran on each cluster node, executed assigned Map/Reduce tasks, and reported status via heartbeat.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>MRv1 suffered from severe limitations:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Scalability Bottleneck and Single Point of Failure (SPOF):</strong> The JobTracker was responsible for too much (scheduling, monitoring, resource management, job coordination). Its memory and CPU overhead created a scalability ceiling (around 4,000 nodes), and if it failed, all running jobs were lost.</li>
                            <li><strong>Resource Underutilization:</strong> TaskTrackers allocated fixed Map slots and Reduce slots. A Map slot could not run a Reduce task, and vice versa. This static allocation led to idle resources and poor utilization, especially when workloads were unbalanced.</li>
                            <li><strong>Limited Workload Flexibility:</strong> MRv1 could only run MapReduce batch programs and could not support other emerging computing paradigms like Machine Learning, Graph algorithms, or real-time streaming analytics.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h2>Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN)</h2>
                        <p>YARN was introduced in Hadoop 2.0 to overcome the limitations of MRv1 by implementing a new resource management layer that is scalable, flexible, and fault-tolerant.</p>

                        <h3>YARN Architecture</h3>
                        <p>YARN fundamentally separated the JobTracker's monolithic responsibilities into specialized components:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li><strong>Resource Manager (RM) (Master):</strong> The single, cluster-wide authority for managing and allocating resources. It consists of the Scheduler (allocates resources/containers) and the Applications Manager (accepts/rejects job submissions, starts/restarts AMs). RM High Availability (HA) was introduced to eliminate the SPOF.</li>
                           <li><strong>Application Master (AM) (Per-Job Coordinator):</strong> Runs one instance per application/job (e.g., one for a MapReduce job, one for a Spark job). It negotiates resource Containers from the RM and manages the execution, progress, and failure recovery of its own application tasks.</li>
                           <li><strong>NodeManager (NM) (Worker Agent):</strong> Runs on every worker node, replacing the TaskTracker. Its job is local resource management: starting/stopping Containers, monitoring resource usage, and reporting node health to the RM.</li>
                           <li><strong>Container (Resource Bundle):</strong> Replaces the fixed slot model. A Container is a dynamic bundle of allocated resources (CPU, memory, etc.) that can run any type of application task (Map, Reduce, Spark Executor, etc.), greatly improving resource utilization and flexibility.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>YARN Failure Handling</h3>
                        <p>YARN significantly improved fault tolerance:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>RM Failure:</strong> Handled by RM High Availability (HA) (Active/Standby RM).</li>
                            <li><strong>AM Failure:</strong> The RM detects the failure and restarts the AM in a new container. The new AM then recovers the state of the running job.</li>
                            <li><strong>NM Failure:</strong> The RM detects the NodeManager failure and informs the relevant AMs. The AMs then reschedule the lost tasks on containers provided by other healthy NodeManagers.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>MapReduce Pseudocode Examples</h2>
                        <p>The MapReduce framework is versatile and can be used to solve many different big data problems. The following three examples illustrate common patterns:</p>

                        <h4>1. Word Counting</h4>
                        <p>The goal is to count the total occurrences of every unique word in a collection of documents. This is the classic MapReduce example.</p>
                        <pre><code>MAP(key, value):
  // key: DocID/ByteOffset, value: Text of the document
  for each word w in value:
    emit(w, 1)

REDUCE (key, values):
  // key: word, values: list of 1s (e.g., [1, 1, 1, ...])
  result = sum(values)
  emit (key, result)
  // Final Output: &lt;word, total_count&gt;
</code></pre>

                        <h4>2. Distributed Grep</h4>
                        <p>The goal is to search for lines matching a specific pattern across many documents. This example shows how the Reducer can simply pass through data, or group data that doesn't need aggregation.</p>
                        <pre><code>MAP(key, value):
  // key: ByteOffset, value: line of text from the document
  if value matches pattern:
    emit("", value)
    // Emitting an empty key ("") ensures all matching lines go
    // to a single Reducer (or are spread if R>1 and partitioner allows).

REDUCE (key, values):
  // key: always "", values: list of matching lines
  for each line in values:
    emit("", line)
  // The Reducer simply concatenates the lines to the output file(s).
</code></pre>

                        <h4>3. URL Access Frequency (Two-Run Job)</h4>
                        <p>The goal is to calculate the access frequency for each unique URL (URLfreq = count(URL) / Total URL accesses (global)), based on web logs. This task requires two sequential MapReduce runs because the global total is needed for normalization.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Run 1: Count Total Global Accesses</h5>
                        <pre><code>MAP_RUN_1(key, value):
  // key: ByteOffset, value: Log Line
  emit("Total_Accesses", 1) // Fixed key sends all counts to one Reducer

REDUCE_RUN_1(key, values):
  // key: "Total_Accesses", values: list of 1s
  GlobalCount = sum(values)
  emit (key, GlobalCount)
  // Final Output of Run 1: &lt;"Total_Accesses", GlobalCount&gt;
</code></pre>

                        <h5>Run 2: Calculate Per-URL Count and Frequency</h5>
                        <p>The global count from Run 1 is assumed to be available as a side input.</p>
                        <pre><code>MAP_RUN_2(key, value):
  // key: ByteOffset, value: Log Line (extract URL)
  URL = extract_url(value)
  emit (URL, 1)

REDUCE_RUN_2(key, values):
  // key: URL, values: list of counts
  URL_Count = sum(values)
  // Look up GlobalCount from the side input of Run 1
  GlobalCount = lookup("Total_Accesses", Run1_Result)
  Frequency = URL_Count / GlobalCount
  emit(key, Frequency)
  // Final Output: &lt;URL, Frequency&gt;
</code></pre>

                        <h2>Introduction to Apache Hive</h2>
                        <p>Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop, designed to provide a familiar SQL-like interface (HiveQL or HQL) for querying and managing massive datasets stored in HDFS (or cloud storage like Amazon S3). Created by Facebook, Hive allows analysts familiar with Structured Query Language (SQL) to leverage the power of distributed computing without writing complex Java MapReduce programs.</p>
                        <p>Hive operates on a principle of <strong>schema-on-read</strong>, meaning the schema is applied when the data is read (at query time), rather than when the data is written (schema-on-write, typical of RDBMS). Hive is primarily optimized for batch analytics and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), not high-frequency Online Transaction Processing (OLTP).</p>

                        <h3>Hive Main Components</h3>
                        <p>Hive's architecture is composed of four main elements:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>HiveQL (High-Level Language):</strong> The SQL-like language used to write queries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Metastore:</strong> Stores all metadata about tables, columns, partitions, and file locations. It is a separate relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).</li>
                            <li><strong>Execution Engine:</strong> Converts HiveQL queries into execution jobs, primarily MapReduce, but modern Hive utilizes faster engines like Tez and Spark.</li>
                            <li><strong>Storage Layer:</strong> Uses Hadoop HDFS by default, but also supports cloud storage like Amazon S3.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>HIVEQL: Comparison and Data Types</h2>

                        <h3>Comparison of SQL and HIVEQL</h3>

                            <li><strong>MAP&lt;K, V&gt;:</strong> An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Keys (K) must be primitive types.</li>
                            <li><strong>STRUCT&lt;name1: T1, name2: T2, ...&gt;:</strong> A collection of named fields (like a record or object). Fields can be of different types.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Complex types can be nested, e.g.: <code>ARRAY&lt;STRUCT&lt;name: STRING, scores: MAP&lt;STRING, INT&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></p>

                        <h3>Data Models: Tables, Partitions, and Buckets</h3>
                        <ul>

                            <li><strong>TEXTFILE (default):</strong> Plain text (CSV, TSV). Easy to read, but slow and large.</li>
                            <li><strong>SEQUENCEFILE:</strong> Row-based, binary, supports compression.</li>
                            <li><strong>ORC (Optimized Row Columnar):</strong> Columnar, compressed, optimized format created specifically for Hive. Best for Hive-only workloads.</li>
                            <li><strong>PARQUET (Columnar, open-standard):</strong> Columnar format used by many systems (Spark, Impala). Best for heterogeneous data lake environments.</li>

                        <pre><code>INSERT INTO | OVERWRITE TABLE table_name
[PARTITION (col1=val1, ...)]
SELECT ... FROM another_table...;</code></pre>
                        
                        <h4>CTAS (Create Table As Select)</h4>
                        <p>CTAS combines CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO in one atomic operation, primarily used for data cleaning, type conversion, and changing storage formats.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example (Cleaning and Format Conversion):</strong> This example cleans raw data stored as TEXTFILE (where data types are strings) and loads it into a clean table stored as ORC with correct types.</p>
                        <pre><code>CREATE TABLE employee_clean
STORED AS ORC
AS
SELECT
  CAST(id AS INT) AS id,
  TRIM(name) AS name, -- Removes surrounding whitespace
  CAST(salary AS FLOAT) AS salary
FROM employee_raw;</code></pre>
                        
                        <h4>Multi-Insert (Hive-Specific Feature)</h4>
                        <p>Allows running multiple INSERT statements from a single source SELECT query. This is a major optimization, as the source table is scanned only once.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example (Single Scan to Three Destinations):</strong></p>
                        <pre><code>FROM sales
INSERT INTO TABLE all_sales
  SELECT year, amount
INSERT INTO TABLE big_sales
  SELECT year, amount WHERE amount > 1000
INSERT INTO TABLE sales_count
  SELECT year, COUNT(*) GROUP BY year;</code></pre>
                        
                        <h4>UPDATE and DELETE</h4>
                        <p>These commands allow row-level modification and deletion, and only work on transactional (ACID) tables.</p>
                        <pre><code>UPDATE table_name SET column = expression WHERE condition;
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

-- Example
UPDATE employee SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE id = 5;
DELETE FROM employee WHERE salary < 3000;
</code></pre>
                        
                        <h4>Merge (UPSERT Capability)</h4>
                        <p>MERGE combines UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE logic into one statement, enabling UPSERT synchronization between a source and a target table. Requires transactional (ACID) tables.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example (Data Synchronization):</strong> Updates existing employee salaries, deletes terminated employees, and inserts new active employees, all in one query.</p>
                        <pre><code>MERGE INTO employee T
USING updates S
ON T.id = S.id
WHEN MATCHED AND S.status = 'terminated' THEN DELETE
WHEN MATCHED AND S.status = 'active' THEN UPDATE SET T.salary = S.new_salary
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND S.status = 'active' THEN INSERT VALUES (S.id, S.name, S.new_salary);</code></pre>
                        
                        <h3>Data Retrieval and Joins (DQL)</h3>
                        <h4>SELECT Query Structure</h4>
                        <pre><code>SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] select_expr, ...
FROM table_reference
[WHERE where_condition]
[GROUP BY col_list]
[HAVING having_condition]
[ORDER BY col_list]
[LIMIT number];</code></pre>

                        <h4>JOIN Types</h4>
                        <p>Hive supports all standard join types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS) plus special, optimized joins.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Left Semi Join (DQL Feature)</h4>
                        <p>A specialized join used for filtering the left table based on the existence of matches in the right table. It returns only columns from the left table and ensures each row from the left table is returned at most once. It is an efficient replacement for the <code>WHERE IN (subquery)</code> pattern.</p>
                        <pre><code>SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name
FROM customers c
LEFT SEMI JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;</code></pre>
                        
                        <h4>Subqueries</h4>
                        <p>Hive fully supports subqueries in the SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses. Subqueries in the FROM clause must be aliased.</p>
                        <pre><code>SELECT dept, avg_salary
FROM (
  SELECT dept, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
  FROM employee
  GROUP BY dept
) AS dept_avg -- Alias is REQUIRED
WHERE avg_salary > 6000;</code></pre>

                            1. Scalability Bottleneck / SPOF: The centralized Job Tracker managed too many responsibilities (scheduling, monitoring, resource management). This high overhead limited the cluster size and created a Single Point of Failure (SPOF).
                            2. Resource Underutilization (Fixed Slots): Worker nodes used rigid, fixed Map slots and Reduce slots. If one type of slot was full while the other was idle, the resources could not be dynamically reassigned, leading to wasted cluster capacity.
                            3. Limited Workload Flexibility: MRv1 was designed only for batch MapReduce programs and could not efficiently support newer, non-MapReduce computation models like graph processing (Giraph), interactive querying (Impala), or fast in-memory analytics (Spark).

                        modelAnswer: `
                           A Partitioner runs first, after the Map phase. Its core function is to decide which Reducer will receive a specific intermediate key-value pair. A user implements a custom Partitioner when the dataset exhibits data skew (one key is much more prevalent than others). A custom Partitioner allows the user to distribute the workload more uniformly across the Reducers.
                           A Combiner runs after the Partitioner but before the Shuffle. Its primary role is optimization. It performs a local aggregation on the Map worker's intermediate output before the data is transferred over the network. This significantly reduces the network traffic during the resource-intensive Shuffle phase, improving job performance.
